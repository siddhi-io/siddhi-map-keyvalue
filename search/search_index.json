If this parameter is set to false the Stream Processor adds the required key to such events with a null value, and the event is converted to a Siddhi event so that you could handle them as required before they are further processed. true BOOL Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 @source(type='inMemory', topic='stock', @map(type='keyvalue')) define stream FooStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); This query performs a default key value input mapping.
